# Day 52: Kubernetes Deployment Rollback  

## ðŸŸ¢ Basics You Should Know  

1. **Deployment** â†’ A Deployment in Kubernetes manages Pods and ReplicaSets. It ensures your app runs with the correct number of pods and the right container image.  

2. **Revision** â†’ Every time you update a Deployment (for example, change the image), Kubernetes saves a new **revision**. Think of revisions like saved checkpoints.  

3. **Rollback** â†’ If the latest update has a bug, you can easily **rollback** to the previous stable version using Kubernetes commands.  

4. **Key Commands** â†’  
   - `kubectl rollout history` â†’ See revision history.  
   - `kubectl rollout undo` â†’ Rollback to previous revision.  
   - `kubectl rollout status` â†’ Verify rollback success.

## ðŸŸ¢ Steps with Commands (Beginner Friendly)  

### Step 1: Check Deployment Rollout History  
See the history of revisions for the deployment:  
```bash
kubectl rollout history deployment/nginx-deployment
```

ðŸ‘‰ This will show the different revisions. The latest one is the buggy release.  

---

### Step 2: Rollback to the Previous Revision  
Run this command to revert the deployment back to the last stable version:  
```bash
kubectl rollout undo deployment/nginx-deployment
```

ðŸ‘‰ This automatically rolls back to the **previous revision**.  

---

### Step 3: Verify the Rollback Status  
Check if the rollback was successful:  
```bash
kubectl rollout status deployment/nginx-deployment
```

ðŸ‘‰ You should see that the deployment has been successfully rolled out.
