# 🚀 Day 100 -- EC2 Setup with CloudWatch Alarm using Terraform

## 🎉 100 Days of KodeKloud -- Challenge Successfully Completed!

Today marks a major milestone in my DevOps journey.\
I am proud to say that I have **successfully completed the 100 Days
KodeKloud Challenge**!\
This final task on **Day 100** focused on automating infrastructure
provisioning and monitoring using **Terraform and AWS**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 📌 Task Title

**Day 100: Launch an EC2 Instance and Monitor CPU Utilization with
CloudWatch Alarm**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🧠 Introduction

On **Day 100** of my DevOps learning journey, I worked on provisioning
AWS infrastructure using **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** and
implementing real-time monitoring using **Amazon CloudWatch**.

The goal of this task was not only to launch an EC2 instance but also to
ensure its performance is continuously monitored. If the system crosses
a critical CPU threshold, alerts should be triggered automatically. This
mirrors real-world DevOps practices where monitoring and alerting are
essential for reliability and uptime.

Completing this task also marks the successful conclusion of my **100
Days KodeKloud Challenge** --- a journey filled with hands-on learning,
automation, and cloud-native practices.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 📋 Problem Statement (In Simple Terms)

For **Day 100**, the requirements were:

1.  Launch an EC2 instance named **`nautilus-ec2`** using an Ubuntu AMI.
2.  Create a CloudWatch alarm named **`nautilus-alarm`**.
3.  Monitor the **CPU Utilization** metric of the instance.
4.  Trigger the alarm if CPU usage is **≥ 90% for one continuous
    5-minute period**.
5.  Send notifications using an existing SNS topic:
    **`nautilus-sns-topic`**.
6.  Output:
    -   EC2 instance name as **`KKE_instance_name`**
    -   Alarm name as **`KKE_alarm_name`**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🔧 Prerequisites

1.  Basic understanding of AWS (EC2, CloudWatch, SNS)
2.  Terraform installed and configured
-   AWS credentials configured using `aws configure`

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 📄 Terraform Configuration

### ▶️ main.tf

``` hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

resource "aws_sns_topic" "sns_topic" {
  name = "nautilus-sns-topic"
}

resource "aws_instance" "nautilus_ec2" {
  ami           = "ami-0c02fb55956c7d316"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  tags = {
    Name = "nautilus-ec2"
  }
}

resource "aws_cloudwatch_metric_alarm" "nautilus_alarm" {
  alarm_name          = "nautilus-alarm"
  comparison_operator = "GreaterThanOrEqualToThreshold"
  evaluation_periods  = 1
  metric_name         = "CPUUtilization"
  namespace           = "AWS/EC2"
  period              = 300
  statistic           = "Average"
  threshold           = 90

  dimensions = {
    InstanceId = aws_instance.nautilus_ec2.id
  }

  alarm_actions = [
    aws_sns_topic.sns_topic.arn
  ]
}
```

## 🌟 Final Words

**Day 100** was not just about completing a task --- it was about
completing a journey.

I have **successfully completed the 100 Days KodeKloud Challenge**,
gaining hands-on experience in AWS, Terraform, monitoring, and DevOps
best practices.

🚀 Onward to bigger challenges!
